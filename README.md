# My Computer Science Education

In this collection of repositories I upload my progress of learning Computer Science
fundamentals, such as <b>algorithms</b>, <b>data structures</b> and <b>patterns and principles</b>
on which they are based.

Now I learn Computer Science using 2 languages: JS (I prefer TS) and Python.
